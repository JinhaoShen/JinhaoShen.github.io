<!-- [CV](http://JinhaoShen.github.io/files/JinhaoShen_CV.pdf) -->

Hey there! I am currently pursuing a Master's degree at Northwestern Polytechnical University, expected to graduate in 2025. My research has focused on the visual interpretation of remote sensing images, and I have a strong interest in multimodal systems and large-scale models.

I'm a sports lover and like to be active. Badminton is my favorite. I enjoy its strategy and reflexes. I also play basketball and table tennis, and run sometimes to keep fit. Sports are good for relaxation and health!
