Hi! Here is Shen Jinhao. I am pursuing the PhD at the department of computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, advised by [Prof. Xiaoyong Wei](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/people/emeritus-honorary-adjunct-and-visiting/wei-xiaoyong---visiting/) and [Prof. Qing Li](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/people/academic-staff/prof-li-qing/). Before it, I got M.S degree at the School of Artificial Intelligence, Optics and Electronics (iOPEN), Northwestern Polytechnical University, advised by [Prof. Qi Wang](https://crabwq.github.io/), [Prof. Yuan Yuan](https://iopen.nwpu.edu.cn/info/1329/1385.htm), and [Prof. Xuelong Li](http://xuelongli.cn/en.php). 

My research interests lie in AIGC, multimodal, and remote sensing.
